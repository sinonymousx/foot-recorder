# Foot-Operated Recorder (Volunteer Project)

Goal: design and iterate an assistive device so a little girl in Japan (no arms) can play a soprano recorder using her feet. This is a volunteer, non-medical project led by KOEIGO STEAM & Language School.

## How to help
- ⭐ Star the repo and share with r/3Dprinting, r/AssistiveTech, music/education groups.
- 💡 Open an issue with an idea: mechanisms, ergonomics, materials, or safety notes.
- 🧩 Contribute designs in `designs/<your-concept>` with CAD + STL + build notes.
- 🧪 Print and test; post results, photos (anonymized), and feedback.

## Design constraints (evolving)
- Enable covering/activating recorder tone holes via toes (precision & reach).
- Comfortable, secure, adjustable; easy to clean.
- No permanent modification to recorder if possible.
- Prioritize low-cost, easy-to-print, parametric parts.

## Ethics & privacy
Do not upload personally identifying images of the child. Use anonymized photos or diagrams. See `docs/safety-and-ethics.md`.

## Licenses
- Code: MIT (see `LICENSES/`)
- Hardware/design files: CERN OHL-S v2 (share-alike for hardware)
